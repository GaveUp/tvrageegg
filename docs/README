Installation Instructions
-------------------------
*Unzip the script to its own directory.
*Add tvrage.tcl to your eggdrop conf.
*For every channel you want the above commands to work on do a ".chanset <channel> +tv".
*For every channel you want the gllogging to work on do a ".chanset <channel> +tvlog".

Custom Triggers
---------------
There are three keys associated with creating a custom trigger: $tvrage(cTriggerX),
$tvrage(cTemplateX), and $tvrage(TemplateX).  In these keys X is userdefined.  The
only requirement is that it must match across all three keys.

$tvrage(cTriggerX)  -- defines the text that will trigger the action.
$tvrage(cTemplateX) -- defines the display format of the output.  The place holder
                       variables available are the same as those for $tvrage(showInfoLine).
$tvrage(cFlagsX)    -- specifies any flag modifiers for the trigger.  If this key does not 
                       exist $tvrage(showinfoFlags) is used.


Example:

To create a trigger "!customTrigger" that displays a show's name you'd need to add the
the following to your tvrage.conf:

set tvrage(cTriggerCustom1) "!customTrigger"
set tvrage(cTemplateCustom1) "PRIVMSG {%%chan%%} :{%%show_name%%}"

For consistency $tvrage(cTemplateCustom1) really should exist in your theme file, but
since custom triggers are custom to a specific setup and not to a theme the custom
configuration file makes more sense.  Note, there is nothing preventing you from 
putting $tvrage(cTemplateCustom1) in your theme file.  If submitting any themes to be
included in the distribution package, though, please exclude and custom trigger 
templates.
